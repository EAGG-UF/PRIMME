# Instruction for getting SPPARKS running on the SmartDATA Lab Lambda server:
# Running the last two commands might also work on other linux machines

# Clone SPPARKS directory - only the included custom version of SPPARKS currently works 
# Clone PRIMME directory
git clone https://github.com/EAGG-UF/PRIMME.git
# Go into the SPPARKS-AGG/src folder
cd ../../SPPARKS/src
# Make lambda
make lambda

# Now PRIMME/train_model_script will run correctly, interfacing with SPPARKS
