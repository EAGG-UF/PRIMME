# Instruction for getting SPPARKS running on the SmartDATA Lab Lambda server:
# Running the last two commend might also work on other linux machines

# Ensure gpuenv is NOT active
source /opt/rh/devtoolset-8/enable
# Clone SPPARKS directory (or use the SPPARKS file already in the folder, only "src", "doc", "python", and "tools" folders are needed)
https://github.com/EAGG-UF/SPPARKS-AGG.git
# Clone PRIMME directory
git clone https://github.com/EAGG-UF/SPPARKS-AGG.git
# Enter PRIMME directory
cd PRIMME/spparks_templates
# Place Makefile.lambda into SPPARKS folder - will already be include in the included custom SPPARKS folder
cp Makefile.lambda ../../SPPARKS/src/MAKE
# Go into the SPPARKS-AGG/src folder
cd ../../SPPARKS/src
#Convert Make.sh file to remove "\r" characters
dos2unix Make.sh
# Make lambda
make lambda

# Now PRIMME/run*.py files will run correctly, interfacing with SPPARKS
