<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command defines an event for the "app_style erbium" application.
It can be an event involving one, two, or three lattice sites, as
specified by <I>Nsite</I>.  The first site is the central site which owns
the event.  The other 2 sites (if specified) are neighors of the
central site.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "app_erbium.html">App_style erbium</A> operates on a 3-fold lattice which
contains fcc, tetrahedral, and octahedral sites.  The <I>site1</I>,
<I>site2</I>, and <I>site3</I> settings specify which kinds of sites are
involved in the event: <I>fcc</I> or <I>tet</I> or <I>oct</I>.  If Nsite = 1, then
only <I>site1</I> is specified.  If Nsite = 2, then only <I>site1</I> and
<I>site2</I> are specified.
</P>
<P>The <I>old1</I>, <I>old2</I>, and <I>old3</I> settings specify what atoms must be on
those sites in order for the event to potentially take place.  The
possible atoms are <I>er</I> for erbium, <I>h</I> for hydrogen, <I>he</I> for helium,
and <I>vac</I> for a vacant site.  E.g. in the first example above, a
Hydrogen atom must be on a tetrahedral site for the event to be
possible.
</P>
<P>The <I>rate</I> setting determines the relative rate at which the event
will occur.  For Nsite=1 events, the units are inverse seconds.  For
Nsite=2 or Nsite=3 events, the units are energy, which is converted
into a rate via the formula:
</P>
<PRE>rate = exp(-energy/kT) 
</PRE>
<P>where T is the <A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> you have specified.
</P>
<P>In this case the <I>rate</I> setting should be in the energy units defined
by the application's Hamiltonian and should be consistent with the
units used in the <A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>new1</I>, <I>new2</I>, and <I>new3</I> settings specify what atoms will be on
which sites if the event takes place.  As with the <I>old</I> settings, the
possible atoms are <I>er</I> for erbium, <I>h</I> for hydrogen, <I>he</I> for helium,
and <I>vac</I> for a vacant site.  E.g. in the first example above, a
Hydrogen atom on a tetrahedral site transmutes into a Helium atom if
the event takes place.
</P>
<P>Note that the set of Nsite=1,2,3 events listed above are a reasonably
full description of a reaction/diffusion model for hydrogen
interstitials in an erbium lattice.
