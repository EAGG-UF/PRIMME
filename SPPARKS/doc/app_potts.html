<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are on-lattice applications which evolve a Q-state Ising model
or Potts model, where each lattice site has a spin value from 1 to Q.
Sites flip their spin as the model evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>Hi = Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and
delta_ij is 0 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 1 if they
are different.  The energy of the entire system is the sum of Hi over
all sites.
</P>
<P>These applications perform Glauber dynamics, meaning the spin is
flipped on a single site.  See <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> for an Ising model which performs
Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two neighboring sites are
swapped.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver or sweeping method to be
used with the application via the <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> or
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip and its
probability is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
using the Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T
is the temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).  The KMC algorithm does not allow spin flips
known as "wild" flips, even at finite temperature.  These are flips to
values that are not equal to any neighbor site value.
</P>
<P>For solution by a rKMC algorithm, the various styles use different
rejection-based algorithms.  For the <I>potts</I> style, a random spin from
1 to Q is chosen.  For the <I>potts/neigh</I> style, a spin is chosen
randomly from the values held by neighbor sites and a null-bin of a
size which extends the possible events up to the maximum number of
neighbors.  For example, imagine a site has 12 neighbors and the 12
sites have 4 different spin values.  Then each of the 4 neighbor spin
values will be chosen with 1/12 probability and the null bin will be
chosen with 8/12 probability.  For the <I>potts/neighonly</I> style, the
null bin is discarded, so in this case each of the 4 spin values will
be chosen with 1/4 probability.  In all the cases, dE = Efinal -
Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform random number R between 0 and
1.  The new state is accepted if R < min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is
rejected.
</P>
<P>The rKMC algorithm for the <I>potts</I> style does allow spin flips known
as "wild" flips.  These are flips to values that are not equal to any
neighbor site value.  At temperature 0.0 these are effectively
disallowed, since they will increase the energy of the system (except
in the uninteresting case when the site already has a spin value not
equal to any neighbor values), but at finite temperature they will
have a non-zero probability of occurring.
