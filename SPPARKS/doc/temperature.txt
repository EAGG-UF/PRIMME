temperature command :h3

[Syntax:]

temperature T :pre

T = value of temperature for the Monte Carlo simulation (energy units) :ul

[Examples:]

temperature 2.0 :pre

[Description:]

This command sets the temperature as used in various applications.
The typical usage would be as part of a Boltzmann factor that alters
the propabilities of event acceptance and rejection.

The units of the specfied temperature should be consistent with how
the application defines energy.  E.g. if used in a Boltzmann factor
where a kT factor scales the energy of a Hamiltonian defined by the
application, then this command is really defining kT and the specified
value should have the units of energy as computed by the Hamiltonian.

[Restrictions:] none

This command can only be used as part of applications that allow for a
temperature to be specified.  See the doc pages for individual
applications defined by the "app_style"_app_style.html command for
further details.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

The default temperature is 0.0.
