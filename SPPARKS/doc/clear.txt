clear command :h3

[Syntax:]

clear :pre

[Examples:]

(commands for 1st simulation)
clear
(commands for 2nd simulation) :pre

[Description:]

This command deletes all data, restores all settings to their default
values, and frees all memory allocated by SPPARKS.  Once a clear
command has been executed, it is as if SPPARKS were starting over,
with only the exceptions noted below.  This command enables multiple
jobs to be run sequentially from one input script.

These settings are not affected by a clear command: the working
directory ("shell"_shell.html command), log file status
("log"_log.html command), echo status ("echo"_echo.html command), and
input script variables ("variable"_variable.html command).

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
