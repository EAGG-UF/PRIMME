<H3>pin command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pin fraction multiflag nthresh 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>fraction = fraction of sites (0 to 1) to convert to pinned sites
<LI>multiflag = 0 for single sites, 1 for sites+neighbors
<LI>nthresh = # of neighbor sites which must have different spins 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pin 0.1 0 2 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command converts sites on a lattice to pinned sites by setting
their spin value to Q+1, where Q is defined by a Potts model.  This
command can only be used by the <A HREF = "app_potts_pin.html">app_style
potts/pin</A> application.  The size of the inclusions
and their location (anywhere or preferentially near grain boundaries)
can be controlled by the <I>multiflag</I> and <I>nthresh</I> parameters.
</P>
<P>The way pinned sites are selected is as follows.  A pinned site is
chosen randomly.  If the site is already a pinned site, then another
site is selected.  If <I>multiflag</I> is set to 1, then if any of the
site's neighbors are already a pinned site, then another site is
selected.  If <I>nthresh</I> is a non-zero value, then the # of neighbor
sites with spin values different than the chosen site are counted.  If
the count is less than <I>nthresh</I>, then another site is selected.
</P>
<P>Once the site is selected, just that site is converted to a pinned site
if <I>multiflag</I> is 0.  If <I>multiflag</I> is 1, then the site plus all
its neibhbors are converted to pinned sites.
</P>
<P>This process continues until the desired fraction of changed sites is
achieved.  The entire process is done in a way that should be
independent of the number of processors used to run a particular
simulation.
</P>
<P>Note that if you pick a large volume fraction and/or a high value for
<I>nthresh</I> it is possible that SPPARKS will never find enough valid
sites to convert to pinned sites.  It will then loop endlessly.
