<H3>deposition command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>deposition rate dirx diry dirz d0 lo hi 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>rate = rate of atom deposition (atom/sec units)
<LI>dirx,diry,dirz = vector in direction of incidence
<LI>d0 = capture distance (distance units)
<LI>lo,hi = min/max coordination number of deposition site 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>deposition	 1.0 0 -1 0 1.0 1 4 
deposition	 1.0 1 1 -1 1.0 3 10 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This commands invokes deposition events in an on-lattice diffusion
model, specified by the <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style diffusion</A>
command.
</P>
<P>Deposition events will compete with diffusive hop events in the
diffusion model.  Each time a deposition event is selected, a random
starting point at the top of the simulation box is selected (top y
surface in 2d, top z surface in 3d).  The atom trajectory is traced
along its incident direction which is specified by (dirx,diry,dirz)
and need not be a unit vector.  However, diry < 0 and dirz = 0 is
required for 2d models.  Similarly, dirz < 0 is required for 3d
models.
</P>
<P>Candidate deposition sites are vacant sites within a perpendicular
distance <I>d0</I> from the incident trajectory which also have a current
coordination number C such that <I>lo</I> <= C <= <I>hi</I>.  Note that <I>d0</I> is
specified in distance units which will depend on how you setup your
lattice via the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command.  For example, if
you specified you lattice constant or box size in Angstroms, then the
distance units for this command are Angstroms as well.
</P>
<P>If the inicident angle is not vertical, then periodic images of the
starting point with associated incident trajectories are considered
and the <I>d0</I> capture distance is applied to whichever trajectory the
candidate site is closest to, in a perpendicular sense.  This means
x-periodicity in 2d and x- and y-periodicity in 3d.
</P>
<P>For the set of candidate sites, the selected deposition site is the
one closest to the starting point, measuring a projected distance
along the incident direction.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">App_style diffusion</A> defines valid
sites as vacant (site value = 1) or occupied (value = 2).  When
performing deposition, a row (2d) or plane (3d) of sites at the top of
the system (where the deposited atoms are incident from) should be set
to a value of 3.  This prevents those sites from being considered as
candidate deposition sites, due to them being neighbors of occupied
sites at the bottom of the system in a periodic sense.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used as part of the <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> application.
</P>
<P>Deposition can currently only be done in serial simulations, not
parallel.  In serial, it can not be used with multiple
<A HREF = "sector.html">sectors</A>, only one sector.
