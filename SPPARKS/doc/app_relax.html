<H3>app_style relax command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style relax delta 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>relax = style name of this application
<LI>delta = maximum displacement distance of a particle (distance units) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style relax 0.5 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is an off-lattice application which treats sites as particles
which interact through a pair potential and whose collective energy is
relaxed via Metropolis Monte Carlo translational moves.
</P>
<P>The energy of a particle I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>Ei = Sum_j phi(Rij) 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor of pariticle I within some
cutoff distance, phi() is the potential energy function defined by the
<A HREF = "pair_style.html">pair_style</A> command, and Rij is the distance between
particles I and J.  The energy of the entire system is the sum of Ei
over all particles.  The <A HREF = "pair_style.html">pair_style</A> command also
defines the cutoff distance.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, this application is
evolved by a Metroplis Monte Carlo (MMC) algorithm.  You must thus
define a sweeping method to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> command.
</P>
<P>For solution by the MMC algorithm, once a particle is chosen, a
translational move of the particle is made, by choosing a random
location within a sphere of radius <I>delta</I> surrounding the particle.
The energy of the particle before and after the move is calculated, to
give dE = Efinal - Einitial.  The move is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected, where R is a uniform random
number R between 0 and 1.
