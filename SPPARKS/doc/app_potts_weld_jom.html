</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is an on-lattice application derived from the <A HREF = "app_potts.html">app_style
potts/neighonly</A> application which simulates a weld
heat source traveling along the y-axis from y = 0 to yhi. The heat
source is centered along the x-axis at x = xhi / 2 and top plane is
located at zhi.
</P>
<P>The model simulates melting and re-solidification by randomizing the
spin at a lattice site when it falls within the melt pool's
volume. Upon exiting the melt pool, a rejection kinetic Monte Carlo
event is performed at the site, and the spin is flipped to the value
of one of its neighbors (in the style of the
<A HREF = "app_potts.html">potts/neighonly</A> application).
</P>
<P>The mobility of each site within the haz decreases exponentially with
increasing distance from the melt pool surface. The maximum mobility
is 1 at the melt pool boundary and the minimum mobility is 0 at the
outer haz boundary. The mobility gradient is similar to that in
<A HREF = "app_potts_grad.html">potts/grad</A>, but is restricted to a portion of
the simulation domain defined by haz.  Outside of the melt pool and
haz, grain boundary mobility is set to 0, and grain evolution does not
occur.

<P>This program was used in the paper by <A HREF = "#Rodgers">Rodgers et al.</A>
</P>
<P>There are five different heat source shapes available defined by the
integer (between 1 and 5) of "weld_type":
</P>
<UL><LI>1 = "ellipsoid", An Goldak-style double ellipsoid heat source whose
melt pool dimensions are defined with "width", "length", "cap_length",
and <A HREF = "ellipsoid_depth.html">ellipsoid_depth</A> 

<LI>2 = "keyhole", A keyhole heat source comprised of the union of two
ellipsoids. A "shallow" ellipsoid whose dimensions are defined with
"width", "length", and <A HREF = "ellipsoid_depth.html">ellipsoid_depth</A>, and a
"deep" ellipsoid whose dimensions are defined with
<A HREF = "deep_width.html">deep_width</A> and <A HREF = "deep_length.html">deep_length</A>. The
"deep" ellipsoid is assumed to penetrate the entire depth of the
simulation domain 

<LI>3 = "linear", A heat source with linearly varying boundaries. The heat
source's cross-section is constant along the z-axis 

<LI>4 = "cap", A heat source with a power-law dependent boundaries. The
heat source's cross-section is constant along the z-axis 

<LI>5 = "circle", A heat source with circular boundaries. The heat
source's cross-section is constant along the z-axis
