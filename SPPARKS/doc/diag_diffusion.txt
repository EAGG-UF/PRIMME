diag_style diffusion command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style diffusion keyword value keyword value ... :pre

diffusion = style name of this diagnostic
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for keyword/value pairs that can be appended to a diagnostic command :ul

[Examples:]

diag_style diffusion :pre

[Description:]

The diffusion diagnostic calculates outputs various statistics about
the different events that have occurred in a cummulative sense since
the simulation began.  These values are printed as stats output via
the "stats"_stats.html command.

There are 4 kinds of events tallied, not all of which may occur
depending on the parameters used in defining the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html model.

successful deposition event
failed deposition event
1st neighbor hop
2nd neighbor hop :ul

A successful deposition event is one that resulted in an atom added to
the lattice.  A failed deposition event is one that was attempted, but
no suitable site could be found and thus no atom was added.  A 1st
neighbor hop is a diffusion hop from a lattice site to a
nearest-neighbor vacancy.  A 2nd neighbor hop is a Schwoebel hop from
a lattice site to a 2nd nearest-neighbor vacancy.  See the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html command for more info on how Schwoebel
hops occur.

[Restrictions:]

This diagnostic can only be used with the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html application.

[Related commands:]

"diag_style"_diag_style.html, "stats"_stats.html

[Default:] none
