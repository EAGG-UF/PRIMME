weld_shape_teardrop command :h3

[Syntax:]

weld_shape_teardrop width w case i :pre

width w = keyword/value pair; w is pool width measured along y-axis :ul
case i = keyword/value pair; i takes on allowable values of I or II or III designating one of the following 3 teardrop shapes :ul

[Examples:]

weld_shape_teardrop width 100.0 case I :pre
weld_shape_teardrop width 100.0 case II :pre
weld_shape_teardrop width 100.0 case III :pre

The three examples above are depicted in the images below.  These images
illustrate cases I, II and III for a fixed width of 100 sites.  Because the
width is fixed, each case produces a different pool length.  NOTE: due to
scaling for this documentation, constant {width=100} for each pool 
shape is not perfectly rendered in images below although they are close.

[Description:]

Specify size and shape of weld pool at top surface of weld.  Shape of pool 
at root surface (bottom) is controlled by {alpha} in "potts/weld"_app_potts_weld.html.
The aspect ratio {length/width} for cases I, II, and III are 1.4, 1.8 and 2.2
respectively.  If a specific width is desired then that is specified directly
in the command and pool length is implied by the aspect ratio.  On the other hand, if a
specific length desired, then the input width must be calculated by hand using the desired
length and aspect ratio.

[Restrictions:]

This command is only valid when used with "potts/weld"_app_potts_weld.html.

[Default:] none
