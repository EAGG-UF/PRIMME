</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This application simulates a model of reaction and diffusion on a
specialized Erbium lattice, which consists of an fcc lattice for the
Erbium and additional tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial sites.
</P>
<P>This application stores 2 integers per lattice site.  The
first integer (i1) is the "type" of the site:
</P>
<UL><LI>type = 1 = fcc
<LI>type = 2 = octahedral
<LI>type = 3 = tetrahedral 
</UL>
<P>The second integer (i2) is the element on the site:
</P>
<UL><LI>element = 1 = erbium
<LI>element = 2 = hydrogen
<LI>element = 3 = helium
<LI>element = 4 = vacancy 
</UL>
<P>The 3-fold lattice should be created using the <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice
fcc/octa/tetra</A> command, which gives details of its
geometry and neighbor connectivity.
</P>
<P>The 3-fold lattice should normally be initialized in the following
way, using the <A HREF = "set.html">set</A> command.  All fcc sites are for erbium
atoms and are fully occupied.  All octahedral sites are initially
vacant.  A fraction of the tetrahedral sites is initialized with
hydrogen atoms; the remainder are vacant.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "event.html">event</A> command is used to define what kinds of
diffusive hops and reaction events occur in the model.  These can
include correlated hops where a central site coordinates a change at
two of its neighbor sites.  Reaction events that transmute a Hydrogen
atom to a Helium are also possible.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, this application can be
evolved only by a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC).  You must thus define a
KMC solver to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, the list of events that can occur at
each site is determined by its current neighbors and by the events
specified via the <A HREF = "event.html">event</A> command.  The relative
probability of each event occurring is computed as a function of the
rate or energy value specified in the <A HREF = "event.html">event</A> command and
the temperature specified via the <A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A>
command.  The details are explained in the doc page for the
<A HREF = "event.html">event</A> command.
