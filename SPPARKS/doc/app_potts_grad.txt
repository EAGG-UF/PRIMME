app_style potts/grad command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style grad_style nspins m0 convert Q T0 grad_x grad_y grad_z :pre

style = {potts/grad}
grad_style = {temp} or {mob}
nspins = number of possible spins
m0 = mobility constant for {temp} grad_style or mobility at the center of domain for {mob} grad_style
convert = conversion factor for the gradients
Q = activation energy
T0 = temperature at the center of domain (temperature units)
grad_x = gradient in the x direction
grad_y = gradient in the y direction
grad_z = gradient in the z direction :ul

[Examples:]

app_style potts/grad temp 10000 .0006 .25 1 350 3 -3 1 
app_style potts/grad temp 10000 .0006 .1  1 375 3.5 3 
app_style potts/grad mob 15000  .5 1 0 0 .0024 0 0 :pre

[Description:]

This is an on-lattice application derived from the "app_style
potts/neighonly"_app_potts.html application which applies gradients
given in three directions x,y, and z.  The gradients can be either
temperature or mobility gradients.  If grad_style {mob} is chosen,
mobility gradients are used.  If grad_style {temp} is chosen,
temperature gradients are used.

When the grad_style {temp} is used, the mobility of each site is
assumed to depend on temperature, according to the equation m0 *
exp(-Q/(KT)), where m0 is the mobility constant, K is Boltzmann's
constant, T is the temperature of the site, and Q is the activation
energy. The temperature of a site depends linearly on its position in
the lattice. The linear function is uniquely defined by the value T0
at the center and the gradients in the x,y, and z directions, grad_x,
grad_y, and grad_z, respectively.  The gradients are in units of
temperature per lattice spacing (defined by the "lattice"_lattice.html
constant).

When the grad_style {mob} is used each site is assigned a mobility
directly from the mobility gradients.  The arguments Q and T0 are not
used during a mobility gradient simulation.  m0 is the initial
mobility at the center of the domain.  The mobility of each site
depends linearly on its position in the lattice.  The linear function
is defined by the mobility gradients.  The mobility gradients are in
units of mobility per lattice spacing (defined by the
"lattice"_lattice.html constant).

Under most circumstances a gradient will break periodicity in the
gradient direction.  This app requires a special method for turning
off periodicity.  Refer to the examples under {potts_grad} for more
details on how to turn periodicity off.

Convert is an argument multiplied by the given gradients and is used
to convert units as a convenience for the user.

Grad_z is an optional argument and will default to zero if not
specified.

The following additional commands are defined by these applications:

"temperature"_temperature.html : set Monte Carlo temperature :tb(s=:)
  
:line

[Restrictions:]

Convert must be > 0.

Only compatible with square and square cubic lattices.

Can only be evolved by a rejection KMC (rKMC) algorithm.  See
"sweep"_sweep.html for more information.

Nspins must be greater than the possible spins set with the
"set"_set.html {site range} command.

[Default:]

As explained above the default for grad_z = 0.0.
