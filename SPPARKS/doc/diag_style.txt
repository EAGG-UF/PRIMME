diag_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style style keyword value keyword value ... :pre

style = {cluster} or {diffusion} or {energy} or {propensity} :ulb,l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {stats} or {delay} or {delt} or {logfreq} or {loglinfreq} :l
  {stats} values = {yes} or {no}
    yes/no = provide output to stats line
  {delay} values = tdelay
    tdelay = delay evaluating diagnostic until at least this time
  {delt} values = delta
    delta = time increment between evaluations of the diagnostic (seconds)
  {logfreq} or {loglinfreq} values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between intervals
:pre

see doc pages for individual diagnostic commands for additional
keywords - diagnostic-specific keywords must come after any other
standard keywords :l,ule

[Examples:]

diag_style cluster stats no delt 1.0 
diag_style energy :pre

[Description:]

This command invokes a diagnostic calculation.  Currently, diagnostics
can only be defined for on-lattice applications.  See the
"app_style"_app_style.html command for an overview of such
applications.

The diagnostics currently available are:

"array"_diag_array.html = statistics of lattice values
"cluster"_diag_cluster.html = grain size statistics for general lattices
"diffusion"_diag_diffusion.html = statistics on diffusion events
"energy"_diag_energy.html = energy of entire system for general lattices
"propensity"_diag_propensity.html = propensity of entire system for general lattices :ul

:line

Diagnostics may provide one or more values that are appended to other
statistical output and printed to the screen and log file via the
"stats"_stats.html command.  This is stats output.  In addition, the
diagnostic may write more extensive output to its own files if
requested by diagnostic-specific keywords.

The {stats} keyword controls whether or not the diagnostic appends
values to the statistical output.  If {stats} is set to {yes}, 
then the frequency of the "stats"_stats.html output will determine 
when the diagnostic is called, and none
of the other keywords related to how often the diagnostic is called can be used. 

If {stats} is set to {no}, then the other keywords related to how often the diagnostic is called 
may be used.  The {delt} keyword specificies {Delta} = the interval of time between each
diagnostic calculation.  

Similarly, the {logfreq} and {loglinfreq} keywords will cause
the diagnostic to run at progressively larger intervals 
during the course of a
simulation.  There will be {N} outputs per interval where the size of
each interval scales up by {factor} each time.  {Delta} is the time
between outputs in the first (smallest) interval. See the "stats"_stats.html
command for more information on how the output times are specified.
See the "stats"_stats.html
command for more information on how the intervals are specified.

If {N} is specified as 0, then this will turn off logarithmic intervals,
and revert to regular intervals of {delta}.

The {delay} keyword specifies the shortest time at which the 
diagnostic can be evaluated. This is useful if it is inconvenient
to evaluate the diagnostic at time t=0.
