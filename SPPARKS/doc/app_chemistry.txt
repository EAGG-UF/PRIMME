app_style chemistry command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style chemistry :pre

chemistry = application style name :ul

[Examples:]

app_style chemistry :pre

[Description:]

This is a general application which evolves a set of coupled chemical
reactions stochastically, producing a time trace of species
concentrations.  Chemical species are treated as counts of individual
molecules reacting within a reaction volume in a well-mixed fashion.
Individual reactions are chosen via the direct method variant of the
Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) of "(Gillespie)"_#Gillespie.

A prototypical example is to use this model to simulate the execution
of a protein signaling network in a biological cell.

This application can only be evolved using a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver to be used with the
application via the "solve_style"_solve_style.html command

:line

The following additional commands are defined by this application:

"add_reaction"_add_reaction.html : define a chemical reaction
"add_species"_add_species.html : define a chemical species
"count"_count.html : specify molecular count of a species
"volume"_volume.html : specify volume of the chemical reactor :tb(s=:)

[Restrictions:] none
