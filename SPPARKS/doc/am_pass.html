<H3>am_pass command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>am_pass id dir d distance D speed V 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>id = integer identification number for this pass
<LI>dir = required keyword
<LI>d = <I>X</I> or <I>Y</I> which specifies direction of the cartesian pass
<LI>distance = required keyword
<LI>D = total pass distance 
<LI>speed = required keyword
<LI>V = scan velocity of the pass in sites/Monte-Carlo-sweep 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>am_pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0 
</PRE>
<PRE>am_pass 2 dir Y distance 100.0 speed 5.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command is used in the <A HREF = "app_potts_additive.html">potts/additive</A>
application to specify the parameters of the pass subcomponent of a
raster pattern.  Multiple passes can be defined in a single input
file, using unique id values.
</P>
<P>Note that the <I>dir</I> value specifies direction of motion and
orientation of the molten pool during a pass.  The pool has its own
local coordinate system <I>x,y</I> so that the pool axis <I>x</I> is always
oriented along <I>dir d</I>.
</P>
<P>The <I>distance</I> value <I>D</I> should typically be the size of the
simulation box in the xy-plane.
</P>
<P>The example commands above define two passes, each with a different
orientation and speed.  The sketch below also illustrates the
<I>overpass</I>; the pool position is always translated by the <I>distance</I>
specfied plus an <I>overpass</I> increment.  The <I>overpass</I> increment is
computed as shown based upon parameters set in the
<A HREF = "app_potts_additive.html">app_potts_additive</A> command.
