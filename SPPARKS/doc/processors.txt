processors command :h3

[Syntax:]

processors Px Py Pz :pre

Px,Py,Pz = # of processors in each dimension of a 3d grid :ul

[Examples:]

processors 2 4 4 :pre

[Description:]

Specify how processors are mapped as a 3d logical grid to the global
simulation box for spatial on-lattice or off-lattice models.

When this command has not been specified, SPPARKS will choose Px, Py,
Pz based on the dimensions of the global simulation box so as to
minimize the surface/volume ratio of each processor's sub-domain.

Since SPPARKS does not load-balance by changing the grid of 3d
processors on-the-fly, this command should be used to override the
SPPARKS default if it is known to be sub-optimal for a particular
problem.

The product of Px, Py, Pz must equal P, the total # of processors
SPPARKS is running on.  If multiple partitions are being used then P
is the number of processors in this partition; see "this
section"_Section_start.html#2_6 for an explanation of the -partition
command-line switch.

If P is large and prime, a grid such as 1 x P x 1 will be required,
which may incur extra communication costs.

[Restrictions:]

This command must be used before the simulation box is defined by a
"read_sites"_read_sites.html or "create_box"_create_box.html command.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

SPPARKS chooses Px, Py, Pz
