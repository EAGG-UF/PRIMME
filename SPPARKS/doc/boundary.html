<H3>boundary command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>dimension x y z 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>x,y,z = <I>p</I> or <I>n</I> in each dimension 

<PRE>  <I>p</I> is periodic
  <I>n</I> is non-periodic 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>boundary p p n 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the style of boundaries for the global simulation box in each
dimension.  The size of the simulation box is set by the
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> or <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> commands.
</P>
<P>The style <I>p</I> means the box is periodic in that dimension, so that
sites can interact across the boundary.
</P>
<P>The styles <I>n</I> means the box is non-periodic in that dimension, so
that sties do not interact across the boundary.
</P>
<P>Note that the interaction of a pair of neighboring sites is really
controlled by each of their neighbor lists which are setup by either
the <A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> or <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read sites</A>
commands.  It is possible to have a periodic system with sites that do
not interact across the periodic boundary, because of the way the
neighbor lists of sites near the boundary are setup.  See the
<A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> or <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read sites</A>
for details.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The boundary command does not yet work
with off-lattice applications.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command must be used before the simulation box is defined by a
<A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> or <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command.
</P>
<P>A 2d simulation must be periodic in the <I>z</I> dimesion.  A 1d simulation
must be periodic in the <I>y</I> and <I>z</I> dimensions.
