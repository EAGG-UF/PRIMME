<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The diffusion diagnostic calculates outputs various statistics about
the different events that have occurred in a cummulative sense since
the simulation began.  These values are printed as stats output via
the <A HREF = "stats.html">stats</A> command.
</P>
<P>There are 4 kinds of events tallied, not all of which may occur
depending on the parameters used in defining the <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> model.
</P>
<UL><LI>successful deposition event
<LI>failed deposition event
<LI>1st neighbor hop
<LI>2nd neighbor hop 
</UL>
<P>A successful deposition event is one that resulted in an atom added to
the lattice.  A failed deposition event is one that was attempted, but
no suitable site could be found and thus no atom was added.  A 1st
neighbor hop is a diffusion hop from a lattice site to a
nearest-neighbor vacancy.  A 2nd neighbor hop is a Schwoebel hop from
a lattice site to a 2nd nearest-neighbor vacancy.  See the <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> command for more info on how Schwoebel
hops occur.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This diagnostic can only be used with the <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> application.
