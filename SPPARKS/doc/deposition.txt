deposition command :h3

[Syntax:]

deposition rate dirx diry dirz d0 lo hi :pre

rate = rate of atom deposition (atom/sec units)
dirx,diry,dirz = vector in direction of incidence
d0 = capture distance (distance units)
lo,hi = min/max coordination number of deposition site :ul

[Examples:]

deposition	 1.0 0 -1 0 1.0 1 4 
deposition	 1.0 1 1 -1 1.0 3 10 :pre

[Description:]

This commands invokes deposition events in an on-lattice diffusion
model, specified by the "app_style diffusion"_app_diffusion.html
command.

Deposition events will compete with diffusive hop events in the
diffusion model.  Each time a deposition event is selected, a random
starting point at the top of the simulation box is selected (top y
surface in 2d, top z surface in 3d).  The atom trajectory is traced
along its incident direction which is specified by (dirx,diry,dirz)
and need not be a unit vector.  However, diry < 0 and dirz = 0 is
required for 2d models.  Similarly, dirz < 0 is required for 3d
models.

Candidate deposition sites are vacant sites within a perpendicular
distance {d0} from the incident trajectory which also have a current
coordination number C such that {lo} <= C <= {hi}.  Note that {d0} is
specified in distance units which will depend on how you setup your
lattice via the "app_style"_app_style.html command.  For example, if
you specified you lattice constant or box size in Angstroms, then the
distance units for this command are Angstroms as well.

If the inicident angle is not vertical, then periodic images of the
starting point with associated incident trajectories are considered
and the {d0} capture distance is applied to whichever trajectory the
candidate site is closest to, in a perpendicular sense.  This means
x-periodicity in 2d and x- and y-periodicity in 3d.

For the set of candidate sites, the selected deposition site is the
one closest to the starting point, measuring a projected distance
along the incident direction.

IMPORTANT NOTE: "App_style diffusion"_app_diffusion.html defines valid
sites as vacant (site value = 1) or occupied (value = 2).  When
performing deposition, a row (2d) or plane (3d) of sites at the top of
the system (where the deposited atoms are incident from) should be set
to a value of 3.  This prevents those sites from being considered as
candidate deposition sites, due to them being neighbors of occupied
sites at the bottom of the system in a periodic sense.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html application.

Deposition can currently only be done in serial simulations, not
parallel.  In serial, it can not be used with multiple
"sectors"_sector.html, only one sector.
