barrier command :h3

[Syntax:]

barrier dstyle Q
barrier dstyle delta Q
barrier dstyle I J Q :pre

dstyle = {hop} or {schwoebel}
Q = barrier height (energy units)
delta = difference in coordination number of 2 participating sites
I,J = coordination numbers of 2 participating sites :ul

[Examples:]

barrier hop 0.25
barrier schwoebel 1 0.3
barrier hop -1 0.35
barrier hop 3 4 0.2
barrier schwoebel * * 0.1
barrier hop 2*5 3* 0.1 :pre

[Description:]

This command sets the energy barrier for a diffusive hop of an atom
from an occupied site to a nearby vacant site.  See the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html command for how the barrier is used in
conjunction with the energy change of the system due to the hop to
calculate a probability for the hop to occur.

Barriers can be assigned to two kinds of diffusive hops.  The first is
a hop to a nearest-neighbor vacancy, which is specified by setting
{dstyle} to {hop}.  The second is a Schwoebel hop to a 2nd
nearest-neighbor vacancy, which is specified by setting {dstyle} to
{schwoebel}.  The latter is only allowed if the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html command also used {schwoebel} for its
dstyle setting.

Barriers are assigned based on two coordination numbers, for the
initial site of the hopping atom and its final site.  In both cases
the coordination count does not include the hopping atom itself.  Thus
typically (Nmax+1)*(Nmax+1) values should be specified by using this
command one or more times, which can be thought of as an (I,J) matrix
entries where both I and J vary from 0 to Nmax inclusive, when Nmax is
the number of neighbor sites for each lattice site.  There is one such
matrix for nearest-neighbor diffusive hops and one for Schwoebel hops.
Also note that it is permissible to have Qij != Qji to set
forward/reverse rates, particularly if the model does not use
energies, but only barriers.

If only one argument Q is specified, then all matrix values are set to
Q.  If the Q value = 0.0, this effectively turns off barriers in the
model.

If two arguments delta and Q are specified, then all matrix
elements where delta = J-I are set to Q.

If three arguments I and J and Q are specified, then the (I,J) element
is set to Q.  In this case, the I.J indices can each be specified in
one of two ways.  An explicit numeric value can be used, as in the 4th
example above.  Or a wild-card asterisk can be used to set the energy
value for multiple coordination numbers.  This takes the form "*" or
"*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If Nmax = the number of neighbor sites, then
an asterisk with no numeric values means all coordination numbers from
0 to Nmax.  A leading asterisk means all coordination numbers from 0
to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all coordination numbers
from n to Nmax (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all coordination
numbers from m to n (inclusive).

The {Q} value should be in the energy units defined by the
application's Hamiltonian and should be consistent with the units used
in any "temperature"_temperature.html command.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html application.

[Related commands:]

"deposition"_deposition.html, "ecoord"_ecoord.html

[Default:]

Energy barriers for all hop events are set to 0, which is effectively
no barriers.
