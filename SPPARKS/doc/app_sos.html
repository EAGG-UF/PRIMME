<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style sos bond_energy keyword args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>sos = application style name 

<LI>bond_energy = lateral bond energy between columns 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>xsin</I> 

<PRE>  <I>xsin</I> args = amp Lx Lz
    amp = amplitude of initial sine wave
    Lx  = wavelength of initial sine wave in x direction
    Lz  = wavelength pf initial sine wave in z direction (ignored if > 1.0e10)

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The SOS (Solid-on-Solid) model is an on-lattice application that
models a solid surface as a 1D or 2D lattice of sites.  At each site
an integer value represents the height of the surface at that site, so
that collectively the heights of all the sites represent a surface
profile with no overhangs or vacancies.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of a site I is:
</P>
<PRE>Hi = 1/2 J Sum_j |h_i - h_j| 
</PRE>
<P>where J is the bond energy, specified through the <I>bond_energy</I>
parameter, and h_i and h_j are the heights at sites I and J.  Sum_j
represents a sum over the nearest neighbors of i, e.g. the neighbors
to the immediate left and right for a 1D lattice.
</P>
<P>If the <I>xsin</I> keyword is used, an initial height profile is assigned
by a sine function.  If the z dependence is inactive (Lz > 1.0e10),
this is
</P>
<PRE>hi = round(amp*sin(2*pi*x/Lx)) 
</PRE>
<P>If the z dependence is active, this is instead:
</P>
<PRE>hi = round(amp * min(sin(2*pi*x/Lx), sin(2*pi*z/Lz))) 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>This application performs Kawasaki dynamics, in which each event
involves an "atom" hopping from one site to a neighboring site.  That
is, an event consists of site I losing one unit of height, and either
site I+1 or I-1 simultaneously gaining one unit of height.
</P>
<P>This application does not allow for use of a rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm; only KMC options are supported.  See <A HREF = "app_style.html">this
page</A> for more information.  For solution by a KMC
algorithm, the probability of each "atom hop" event is min[P0,
P0*exp(-dE/kT)], where P0 is a scaling factor, dE = Efinal - Einitial
using the Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T
is the temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).  The scaling factor P0 is given by 1/nn where
nn is the number of nearest neighbors for each site.
