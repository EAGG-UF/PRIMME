am_cartesian_layer command :h3

[Syntax:]

am_cartesian_layer layer_id start_position x y pass_id p_id transverse_pass_id t_id serpentine switch :pre

layer_id = integer identification number for this cartesian_layer
start_position = required keyword
x y = coordinates of initial molten zone location
pass_id = required keyword
p_id = integer ID of the pass to use for this layer
transverse_pass_id = required keyword
t_id = integer ID of the transverse pass to use for this layer
serpentine = required keyword
switch = 0 for parallel, 1 for anti-parallel for successive passes :ul

[Examples:]

am_pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0
am_transverse_pass 1 distance 65.0 increment 10
am_cartesian_layer 1 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 0
am_cartesian_layer 2 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 1 :pre

[Description:]

This command is used in the "potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html
application to specify the cartesian_layer subcomponent of a raster
"pattern"_am_pattern.html.  Multiple cartesian_layers can be defined
in a single input file, using unique id values.

The {start_position} values x,y are typically the bottom-left corner
of the simulation domain.

The {pass_id} value {p_id} is defined by the "pass"_am_pass.html
command.  The {transverse_pass_id} value {t_id} is defined by the
"transverse_pass"_am_transverse_pass.html command.

Note that the x,y values are "pass"_am_pass.html sensitive.  If a pass
defines {dir X}, then the start_position should be at the lower left
corner of raster domain (as defined by the pass and
transverse_pass). If the pass defined {dir Y}, then the start position
should be at the lower right corner of the raster domain.  See a
schematic of the latter case in the "pass"_am_pass.html command.

In the above example, two unique layers (with and without serpentine)
are created.  Note re-use of the "pass"_am_pass.html and
"transverse_pass"_am_transverse_pass.html commands.  The schematic
below depicts the two layers.  Note how {overpass} interacts with
{serpentine}.
