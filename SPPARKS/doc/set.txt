set command :h3

[Syntax:]

set label style args keyword values ... :pre

label = {site} or {iN} or {dN} or {x} or {y} or {z} or {xyz} :ulb,l
style = {value} or {range} or {displace} :l
  {value} arg = nvalue
    nvalue = value to set sites to
  {range} args = lo hi
    lo,hi = range of values to set sites to
  {unique} args = none
  {displace} arg = delta
     delta = max distance to displace the site :pre
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {fraction} or {region} or {loop} or {if} :l
  {fraction} value = frac
    frac = number > 0 and <= 1.0
  {region} args = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of region that sites must be part of
  {loop} arg = {all} or {local}
    all = loop over all sites
    local = loop over only sites I own
  {if} args = label2 op nvalue2
    label2 = {id} or {iN} or {dN} or {x} or {y} or {z}
    op = "<" or "<=" or ">" or "<=" or "=" or "!="
    nvalue2 = value to compare site value to :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

set i1 value 2 fraction 0.5
set d1 range 1.0 2.0 loop local
set xyz displace 0.2
set i1 range 1 50 if x < 20 if i2 = 3 :pre

[Description:]

Reset a per-site value for one or more sites.  Each on-lattice or
off-lattice application defines what per-site values are stored with
each site in its model.  When sites are created by the
"create_sites"_create_sites.html or "read_sites"_read_sites.html
commands, their per-site values may be set to zero or to values
specified by those commands.  This command enables the values to be
changed, either before the first "run"_run.html, or between runs.

The {label} determines which per-site quantity is set.  {iN} and {dN}
mean the Nth integer or floating-point quantity, with 1 <= N <= Nmax.
Nmax is defined by the application.  If {label} is specified as {site}
it is the same as {i1}.  For off-lattice applications, the {x} or {y}
or {z} or {xyz} coordinates of each site can be adjusted.

For label {iN} or {dN} or {site}, the styles {value} or {range} can be used.

For style {value}, the per-site quantity is set to the specified
{nvalue}, which should be either an integer or floating-point numeric
value, depending on what kind of per-site quantity is being set.

For style {range}, the per-site quantity is set to a random value
between {lo} and {hi} (inclusive).  Both {lo} and {hi} should be
either integer or floating-point numeric values, depending on what kind
of per-site quantity is being set.

For style {unique}, the per-site quantity is set to the site ID, which
is effectively a value unique to each site.  This can be useful, for
example, for setting the initial spin of each site to a unique value.

NOTE: The {displace} style is not yet implemented but will be soon.
The following text explains how it will work for off-lattice
applications.

For label {x} or {y} or {z} or {xyz}, the style {displace} must be
used.  For {x} or {y} or {z}, the corresponding coordinate of each
site is displaced by a random distance between -{delta} and {delta}.
For {xyz} the site is displaced to a new random point within a sphere
of radius {delta} surrounding the site (or a circle for 2d models, or
a line segement for 1d models).

The optional keywords enables selection of sites whose {label}
quantity will be reset to a new value.  Note that these optional
keywords can be used in various combinations, and the {if} keyword can
be used multiple times, to select desired sites.

The keyword {fraction} means that only a fraction of the sites will
be reset, where 0 < {frac} <= 1.0.  For each site a random number R is
generated and the reset only occurs if R < {frac}.

The keyword {region} means that only sites in the specified region
will be reset.  Note that a defined region can be a union or
intersection of several regions and can be either inside or outside a
geometric boundary; see the "region"_region.html command for details.

The keyword {loop} determines how sites in the simulation box are
looped over when their per-site quantity is reset.  In general, each
processor will own some subset Nlocal of the total number of sites
Nglobal in the simulation box.  The entire set of sites are assumed to
have IDs from 1 to Nglobal.  For {loop all}, each processor performs a
loop from 1 to Nglobal and generates the new value for that site.  If
it owns the site, then it resets its value.  This means that the
changes to per-site values will be the same, independent of which
processor owns which site.  For {loop local}, each processor loops
over only its sites from 1 to Nlocal.  This may be faster, but if
random numbers are used to determine new per-site values, it will give
different answers depending on the the number of processors used.

The keyword {if} sets a condition that must be met in order for the
per-site quantity to be reset.  The per-site quantity specified by
{label2} is compared to the numeric {nvalue2} and if the condition is
not met, then the site is skipped.

[Restrictions:] none

[Default:]

The default values for the optional keywords is fraction 1.0 and loop
all.  No region is defined by default nor are any if-tests.
