app_style relax command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style relax delta :pre

relax = style name of this application
delta = maximum displacement distance of a particle (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

app_style relax 0.5 :pre

[Description:]

This is an off-lattice application which treats sites as particles
which interact through a pair potential and whose collective energy is
relaxed via Metropolis Monte Carlo translational moves.

The energy of a particle I is as follows:

Ei = Sum_j phi(Rij) :pre

where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor of pariticle I within some
cutoff distance, phi() is the potential energy function defined by the
"pair_style"_pair_style.html command, and Rij is the distance between
particles I and J.  The energy of the entire system is the sum of Ei
over all particles.  The "pair_style"_pair_style.html command also
defines the cutoff distance.

As explained on "this page"_app_style.html, this application is
evolved by a Metroplis Monte Carlo (MMC) algorithm.  You must thus
define a sweeping method to be used with the application via the
"sweep"_sweep.html command.

For solution by the MMC algorithm, once a particle is chosen, a
translational move of the particle is made, by choosing a random
location within a sphere of radius {delta} surrounding the particle.
The energy of the particle before and after the move is calculated, to
give dE = Efinal - Einitial.  The move is accepted if R <
min\[1,exp(-dE/kT)\], else it is rejected, where R is a uniform random
number R between 0 and 1.
