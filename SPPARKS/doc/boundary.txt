boundary command :h3

[Syntax:]

dimension x y z :pre

x,y,z = {p} or {n} in each dimension :ulb,l
  {p} is periodic
  {n} is non-periodic :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

boundary p p n :pre

[Description:]

Set the style of boundaries for the global simulation box in each
dimension.  The size of the simulation box is set by the
"create_box"_create_box.html or "read_sites"_read_sites.html commands.

The style {p} means the box is periodic in that dimension, so that
sites can interact across the boundary.

The styles {n} means the box is non-periodic in that dimension, so
that sties do not interact across the boundary.

Note that the interaction of a pair of neighboring sites is really
controlled by each of their neighbor lists which are setup by either
the "create_sites"_create_sites.html or "read sites"_read_sites.html
commands.  It is possible to have a periodic system with sites that do
not interact across the periodic boundary, because of the way the
neighbor lists of sites near the boundary are setup.  See the
"create_sites"_create_sites.html or "read sites"_read_sites.html
for details.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The boundary command does not yet work
with off-lattice applications.

[Restrictions:]

This command must be used before the simulation box is defined by a
"read_sites"_read_sites.html or "create_box"_create_box.html command.

A 2d simulation must be periodic in the {z} dimesion.  A 1d simulation
must be periodic in the {y} and {z} dimensions.
