<H3>temperature command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>temperature T 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>T = value of temperature for the Monte Carlo simulation (energy units) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>temperature 2.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command sets the temperature as used in various applications.
The typical usage would be as part of a Boltzmann factor that alters
the propabilities of event acceptance and rejection.
</P>
<P>The units of the specfied temperature should be consistent with how
the application defines energy.  E.g. if used in a Boltzmann factor
where a kT factor scales the energy of a Hamiltonian defined by the
application, then this command is really defining kT and the specified
value should have the units of energy as computed by the Hamiltonian.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none
</P>
<P>This command can only be used as part of applications that allow for a
temperature to be specified.  See the doc pages for individual
applications defined by the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for
further details.
</P>
<P><B>Related commands:</B> none
</P>
<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>The default temperature is 0.0.
