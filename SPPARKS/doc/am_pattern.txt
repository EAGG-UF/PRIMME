am_pattern command :h3

[Syntax:]

am_pattern id num_layers N layer_ids l_ids z_start z_init z_increment dz :pre

id = integer identification number for this pattern
num_layers = required keyword
N = number of unique layers for this pattern
layer_ids = required keyword
layer_ids  = list of N integer IDs of the cartesian layers in this pattern
z_start = required keyword
z_init = initial z-value elevation for the pattern
z_increment = required keyword
dz = z-elevation increment between layers :ul

[Examples:]

am_pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0
am_transverse_pass 1 distance 65.0 increment 10
am_cartesian_layer 1 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 0
am_cartesian_layer 2 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 1
am_pattern 1 num_layers 2 layer_ids 1 2 z_start 0.0 z_increment 5.0 :pre

[Description:]

This command is used in the "potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html
application to specify the raster pattern used in a simulation. A
pattern allows for the use of multiple predefined layers.

As mentioned above, a pattern can be defined with an arbitrary number
of layers.  Each layer is separated by an increment in the
z-elevation.  Once all of the layers have been cycled through, the
pattern repeats itself be cycling through the layers again and again
until the simulation is completed.

The {z_start} value {z_init} should typically be <= molten zone depth
for complete coverage.

The {z_increment} value {dz} should typically be <= molten zone depth
for complete coverage and overlap.

The above example commands build on the example from the
"cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html command.  Two layers are
used to define a repeating raster {pattern} as the tool builds a {3D}
volume layer by layer incrementally in the spparks {z} coordinate
direction.  The first layer is added beginning with a {z} elevation of
{z=z_start=0.0}.  The second layer is added at an elevation of
{z_increment=5.0}.  Since the {pattern} only has 2 layers, it repeats
{layer 1} beginning at {z=10.0} and {layer 2} at {z=15.0}.  The
pattern continues to repeat for the duration of the simulation with
each layer added incrementally above the previous layer.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html application.
