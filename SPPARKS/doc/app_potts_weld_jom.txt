app_style potts/weld/jom command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style potts/weld/jom nspins width length cap_length linear haz start_weld velocity weld_type exp_factor :pre

potts/weld/jom = application style name
nspins = number of possible spins
width = maximum width of the melt pool
length = maximum length of the melt pool trailing the melt spot
cap_length = specify the length of the heat source region leading the melt spot
haz = width of the heat affected zone (haz) surrounding the melt pool
start_weld = timestep at which to begin welding (usually 0)
velocity = velocity of heat source motion (lattice sites per Monte Carlo step)
weld_type = heat source shape (valid options are 1-5, see below)
exp_factor = rate of exponential decay of the haz mobility gradient :ul
  
:ule

[Examples:]

app_style potts/weld/jom 10000 30 25 10 40 0 10.0 1 0.01 :pre

[Description:]

This is an on-lattice application derived from the "app_style
potts/neighonly"_app_potts.html application which simulates a weld
heat source traveling along the y-axis from y = 0 to yhi. The heat
source is centered along the x-axis at x = xhi / 2 and top plane is
located at zhi.

The model simulates melting and re-solidification by randomizing the
spin at a lattice site when it falls within the melt pool's
volume. Upon exiting the melt pool, a rejection kinetic Monte Carlo
event is performed at the site, and the spin is flipped to the value
of one of its neighbors (in the style of the
"potts/neighonly"_app_potts.html application).

The mobility of each site within the haz decreases exponentially with
increasing distance from the melt pool surface. The maximum mobility
is 1 at the melt pool boundary and the minimum mobility is 0 at the
outer haz boundary. The mobility gradient is similar to that in
"potts/grad"_app_potts_grad.html, but is restricted to a portion of
the simulation domain defined by haz.  Outside of the melt pool and
haz, grain boundary mobility is set to 0, and grain evolution does not
occur.

This program was used in the paper by "Rodgers et al."_#Rodgers

There are five different heat source shapes available defined by the
integer (between 1 and 5) of "weld_type":

1 = "ellipsoid", An Goldak-style double ellipsoid heat source whose
melt pool dimensions are defined with "width", "length", "cap_length",
and "ellipsoid_depth"_ellipsoid_depth.html :ulb,l

2 = "keyhole", A keyhole heat source comprised of the union of two
ellipsoids. A "shallow" ellipsoid whose dimensions are defined with
"width", "length", and "ellipsoid_depth"_ellipsoid_depth.html, and a
"deep" ellipsoid whose dimensions are defined with
"deep_width"_deep_width.html and "deep_length"_deep_length.html. The
"deep" ellipsoid is assumed to penetrate the entire depth of the
simulation domain :l

3 = "linear", A heat source with linearly varying boundaries. The heat
source's cross-section is constant along the z-axis :l

4 = "cap", A heat source with a power-law dependent boundaries. The
heat source's cross-section is constant along the z-axis :l

5 = "circle", A heat source with circular boundaries. The heat
source's cross-section is constant along the z-axis :l,ule

:line

The following additional commands are defined by this application:
 
"ellipsoid_depth"_ellipsoid_depth.html : define the maximum depth of the ellipsoid-shaped melt pool, or the maximum depth of the shallow melt pool in the keyhole model
"deep_width"_deep_width.html : define the maximum width of the deep ellipsoid in the keyhole model
"deep_length"_deep_length.html : define the maximum length of the deep ellipsoid in the keyhole model :tb(s=:)
  
:line

[Restrictions:] :link(restriction) 

Only compatible with square and square cubic lattices.

Can only be evolved by a rejection KMC (rKMC) algorithm.  See "sweep"_sweep.html for more information.

Melt pool width + haz must be =< xhi.
