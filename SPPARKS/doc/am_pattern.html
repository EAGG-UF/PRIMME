<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>am_pattern id num_layers N layer_ids l_ids z_start z_init z_increment dz 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>id = integer identification number for this pattern
<LI>num_layers = required keyword
<LI>N = number of unique layers for this pattern
<LI>layer_ids = required keyword
<LI>layer_ids  = list of N integer IDs of the cartesian layers in this pattern
<LI>z_start = required keyword
<LI>z_init = initial z-value elevation for the pattern
<LI>z_increment = required keyword
<LI>dz = z-elevation increment between layers 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>am_pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0
am_transverse_pass 1 distance 65.0 increment 10
am_cartesian_layer 1 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 0

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command is used in the <A HREF = "app_potts_additive.html">potts/additive</A>
application to specify the raster pattern used in a simulation. A
pattern allows for the use of multiple predefined layers.
</P>
<P>As mentioned above, a pattern can be defined with an arbitrary number
of layers.  Each layer is separated by an increment in the
z-elevation.  Once all of the layers have been cycled through, the
pattern repeats itself be cycling through the layers again and again
until the simulation is completed.
</P>
<P>The <I>z_start</I> value <I>z_init</I> should typically be <= molten zone depth
for complete coverage.
</P>
<P>The <I>z_increment</I> value <I>dz</I> should typically be <= molten zone depth
for complete coverage and overlap.
</P>
<P>The above example commands build on the example from the
<A HREF = "am_cartesian_layer.html">cartesian_layer</A> command.  Two layers are
used to define a repeating raster <I>pattern</I> as the tool builds a <I>3D</I>
volume layer by layer incrementally in the spparks <I>z</I> coordinate
direction.  The first layer is added beginning with a <I>z</I> elevation of
<I>z=z_start=0.0</I>.  The second layer is added at an elevation of
<I>z_increment=5.0</I>.  Since the <I>pattern</I> only has 2 layers, it repeats
<I>layer 1</I> beginning at <I>z=10.0</I> and <I>layer 2</I> at <I>z=15.0</I>.  The
pattern continues to repeat for the duration of the simulation with
each layer added incrementally above the previous layer.
