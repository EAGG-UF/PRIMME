app_style erbium command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style erbium :pre

erbium = style name of this application :ul

[Examples:]

app_style erbium :pre

[Description:]

This application simulates a model of reaction and diffusion on a
specialized Erbium lattice, which consists of an fcc lattice for the
Erbium and additional tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial sites.

This application stores 2 integers per lattice site.  The
first integer (i1) is the "type" of the site:

type = 1 = fcc
type = 2 = octahedral
type = 3 = tetrahedral :ul

The second integer (i2) is the element on the site:

element = 1 = erbium
element = 2 = hydrogen
element = 3 = helium
element = 4 = vacancy :ul

The 3-fold lattice should be created using the "lattice
fcc/octa/tetra"_lattice.html command, which gives details of its
geometry and neighbor connectivity.

The 3-fold lattice should normally be initialized in the following
way, using the "set"_set.html command.  All fcc sites are for erbium
atoms and are fully occupied.  All octahedral sites are initially
vacant.  A fraction of the tetrahedral sites is initialized with
hydrogen atoms; the remainder are vacant.

The "event"_event.html command is used to define what kinds of
diffusive hops and reaction events occur in the model.  These can
include correlated hops where a central site coordinates a change at
two of its neighbor sites.  Reaction events that transmute a Hydrogen
atom to a Helium are also possible.

As explained on "this page"_app_style.html, this application can be
evolved only by a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC).  You must thus define a
KMC solver to be used with the application via the
"solve_style"_solve_style.html command.

For solution by a KMC algorithm, the list of events that can occur at
each site is determined by its current neighbors and by the events
specified via the "event"_event.html command.  The relative
probability of each event occurring is computed as a function of the
rate or energy value specified in the "event"_event.html command and
the temperature specified via the "temperature"_temperature.html
command.  The details are explained in the doc page for the
"event"_event.html command.
