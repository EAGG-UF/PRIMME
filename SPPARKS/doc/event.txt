event command :h3

[Syntax:]

event Nsite site1 site2 site3 old1 old2 old3 rate new1 new2 new3 :pre

Nsite = number of lattice sites involved in the event = 1,2,3
site1,site2,site3 = {fcc} or {tet} or {oct}
old1,old2,old3 = {er} or {h} or {he} or {vac}
rate = rate constant for the event (inverse seconds or energy units)
new1,new2,new3 = {er} or {h} or {he} or {vac} :ul

[Examples:]

event	        1 tet h 1.78279E-9 he
event		1 oct h 1.78279E-9 he :pre

event	        2 tet tet h vac 0.98 vac h
event	        2 tet oct h vac 1.89 vac h
event	        2 tet oct vac h 0.68 h vac
event		2 tet tet he vac 0.49 vac he
event		2 oct oct he vac 1.49 vac he :pre

[Description:]

This command defines an event for the "app_style erbium" application.
It can be an event involving one, two, or three lattice sites, as
specified by {Nsite}.  The first site is the central site which owns
the event.  The other 2 sites (if specified) are neighors of the
central site.

"App_style erbium"_app_erbium.html operates on a 3-fold lattice which
contains fcc, tetrahedral, and octahedral sites.  The {site1},
{site2}, and {site3} settings specify which kinds of sites are
involved in the event: {fcc} or {tet} or {oct}.  If Nsite = 1, then
only {site1} is specified.  If Nsite = 2, then only {site1} and
{site2} are specified.

The {old1}, {old2}, and {old3} settings specify what atoms must be on
those sites in order for the event to potentially take place.  The
possible atoms are {er} for erbium, {h} for hydrogen, {he} for helium,
and {vac} for a vacant site.  E.g. in the first example above, a
Hydrogen atom must be on a tetrahedral site for the event to be
possible.

The {rate} setting determines the relative rate at which the event
will occur.  For Nsite=1 events, the units are inverse seconds.  For
Nsite=2 or Nsite=3 events, the units are energy, which is converted
into a rate via the formula:

rate = exp(-energy/kT) :pre

where T is the "temperature"_temperature.html you have specified.

In this case the {rate} setting should be in the energy units defined
by the application's Hamiltonian and should be consistent with the
units used in the "temperature"_temperature.html command.

The {new1}, {new2}, and {new3} settings specify what atoms will be on
which sites if the event takes place.  As with the {old} settings, the
possible atoms are {er} for erbium, {h} for hydrogen, {he} for helium,
and {vac} for a vacant site.  E.g. in the first example above, a
Hydrogen atom on a tetrahedral site transmutes into a Helium atom if
the event takes place.

Note that the set of Nsite=1,2,3 events listed above are a reasonably
full description of a reaction/diffusion model for hydrogen
interstitials in an erbium lattice.
