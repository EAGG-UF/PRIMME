<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Modify the parameters of a previously defined dump command.  Not all
parameters are relevant to all dump styles.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<P>These keywords apply to various dump styles, including the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> style, except as noted below.  The descriptions
give details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>delay</I> keyword will suppress output until <I>tdelay</I> time has
elapsed.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>delta</I> keyword will suppress output until <I>tdelay</I> time has
elapsed.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>fileper</I> keyword is documented below with the <I>nfile</I> keyword.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>first</I> keyword can be used to set the counter used to enumerate
successive snapshots.  This can be useful when continuing/restarting a
previous simulation, so as not to overlap new snapshots with previous
output.
</P>
<P>The counter is used in the TIMESTEP field of snapshots produced by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump text</A> or <A HREF = "dymp.html">dump sites</A> styles.  It is also
used in the filenames generated by the "*" wildcard character in the
user-specified dump file name, as explained on the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A>
command doc page.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>flush</I> option determines whether a flush operation in invoked
after a dump snapshot is written to the dump file.  A flush insures
the output in that file is current (no buffering by the OS), even if
SPPARKS halts before the simulation completes.  The <I>flush</I> option is
only relevant to the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump text</A> style.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>logfreq</I> and <I>loglinfreq</I> keywords will produce output at
progressively larger intervals during the course of a simulation.
There will be <I>N</I> outputs per interval where the size of each interval
is initially <I>delta</I> and then scales up by <I>factor</I> each time. See the
<A HREF = "stats.html">stats</A> command for more information on how the output
times are specified.
</P>
<P>If <I>N</I> is specified as 0, then this will turn off logarithmic output,
and revert to regular output every <I>delta</I> seconds.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>nfile</I> or <I>fileper</I> keywords currently apply only to the <I>text</I>
dump style.  They can be used in conjunction with the "%" wildcard
character in the specified dump file name.  As explained on the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command doc page, the "%" character causes the dump
file to be written in pieces, one piece for each of P processors.  By
default P = the number of processors the simulation is running on.
The <I>nfile</I> or <I>fileper</I> keyword can be used to set P to a smaller
value, which can be more efficient when running on a large number of
processors.
</P>
<P>The <I>nfile</I> keyword sets P to the specified Nf value.  For example, if
Nf = 4, and the simulation is running on 100 processors, 4 files will
be written, by processors 0,25,50,75.  Each will collect information
from itself and the next 24 processors and write it to a dump file.
</P>
<P>For the <I>fileper</I> keyword, the specified value of Np means write one
file for every Np processors.  For example, if Np = 4, every 4th
processor (0,4,8,12,etc) will collect information from itself and the
next 3 processors and write it to a dump file.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>pad</I> keyword only applies when the dump filename is specified
with a wildcard "*" character which becomes the timestep.  If <I>pad</I> is
0, which is the default, the timestep is converted into a string of
unpadded length, e.g. 100 or 12000 or 2000000.  When <I>pad</I> is
specified with <I>Nchar</I> > 0, the string is padded with leading zeroes
so they are all the same length = <I>Nchar</I>.  For example, pad 7 would
yield 0000100, 0012000, 2000000.  This can be useful so that
post-processing programs can easily read the files in ascending
timestep order.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>region</I> keyword allows sub-selection of lattice sites to output.
If specified, only sites in the region will be written to the dump
file or included in the image.  Only one region can be applied as a
filter (the last one specified).  See the <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command
for more details.  Note that a region can be defined as the "inside"
or "outside" of a geometric shape, and it can be the "union" or
"intersection" of a series of simpler regions.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>sort</I> keyword determines whether lines of per-site output in a
snapshot are sorted or not.  A sort value of <I>off</I> means they will
typically be written in indeterminate order, at least in parallel,
since the sites are written to file in per-processor chunks.  A sort
value of <I>id</I> means sort the output by site ID.  A sort value of N or
-N means sort the output by the value in the Nth column of per-site
info in either ascending or descending order.
</P>
<P>If multiple processors are writing the dump file, via the "%" wildcard
in the dump filename, then sorting cannot be performed.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Sorting dump file output requires extra overhead in
terms of CPU and communication cost, as well as memory, versus
unsorted output.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>thresh</I> keyword allows sub-selection of lattice sites to output.
Multiple thresholds can be specified.  Specifying "none" turns off all
threshold criteria.  If thresholds are specified, only sites whose
attributes meet all the threshold criteria are written to the dump
file or included in the image.  The possible attributes that can be
tested for are the same as the fields that can be specified in the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command.  Note that different attributes can be
output by the dump command than are used as threshold criteria by the
dump_modify command.  E.g. you can output the coordinates and
propensity of sites whose energy is above some threshold.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>vtk</I> keyword only applies to the <I>vtk</I> style, for which it is
required.  As explained on the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump vtk</A> doc page, this
style can only be used to output a single per-site value for a regular
lattice of sites.  The settings for this command provide information
about the underlying lattice and site value bounds.
</P>
<P>The nx,ny,nz settings are the extent of the regular lattice of sites,
whether it is periodic in any dimension or not.  Use a value of nz = 1
for 2d simulations and ny = nz = 1 for 1d simulations.
</P>
<P>The minvalue and maxvalue settings are the min/max bounds within which
all the per-site values for the specified single per-site field will
fall.  Note that the actual values do not need to extend to these
bounds.  E.g. the maximum initial spin value might be 1000 (e.g. for
<A HREF = "app_potts.html">app_style potts</A>), but at later times an individual
snapshot would have no spins > 900.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<P>These keywords apply only to the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> style.
The descriptions give details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>backcolor</I> sets the background color of the images.  The color
name can be any of the 140 pre-defined colors (see below) or a color
name defined by the dump_modify color option.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>boundcolor</I> keyword sets the color used to draw boundaries
between sites, each of which is a set of 4 cylinders, as described in
the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> doc page.  The color name can be any
of the 140 pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by
the dump_modify color option.
</P>
<P>The drawing of boundaries between neighboring sites is enabled by the
<I>boundary</I> keyword of the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> command.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>boxcolor</I> keyword sets the color of the simulation box drawn
around the sites in each image.  See the "dump image box" command for
how to specify that a box be drawn.  The color name can be any of the
140 pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the
dump_modify color option.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>color</I> keyword allows definition of a new color name, in addition
to the 140-predefined colors (see below), and associates 3
red/green/blue RGB values with that color name.  The color name can
then be used with any other dump_modify keyword that takes a color
name as a value.  The RGB values should each be floating point values
between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
</P>
<P>When a color name is converted to RGB values, the user-defined color
names are searched first, then the 140 pre-defined color names.  This
means you can also use the <I>color</I> keyword to overwrite one of the
pre-defined color names with new RBG values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>cwrap</I> keyword enables wrapping of integer values used to
deterimine site colors in the image, into the range specified by the
<I>crange</I> keyword in the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>crange</I> keyword defines a range of values <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I>.  If the
<I>cwrap</I> argument is <I>no</I>, which is the default, then values outside
the range <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I> are clipped to that range.  I.e. values < <I>lo</I>
become <I>lo</I> and values > <I>hi</I> become hi.  This means out-of-range
values will all be drawn with either the <I>lo</I> or <I>hi</I> color, which may
not be what you want.
</P>
<P>If the <I>cwrap</I> argument is <I>yes</I>, then values outside the range <I>lo</I>
to <I>hi</I> are wrapped back into the range.  E.g. a value of hi+1 becomes
lo, hi+2 becomes lo+1, etc.  Similarly, a value of lo-1 becomes hi,
lo-2 becomes hi-1, etc.  This is a way to map a huge number N of
possible integer values into a smaller number of M <I>crange</I> colors.
This may be required if N = 2 billion spin values, since memory for
that many colors cannot be allocated.  Using a <I>crange</I> with M = 10000
would work in that scenario.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>dwrap</I> keyword enables wrapping of integer values used to
deterimine site diameters in the image, into the range specified by
the <I>drange</I> keyword in the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> command.
It's purpose and the way it operates on diamenters is exactly the same
as how the <I>cwrap</I> keyword operates of colors, as described above.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>scolor</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A>
command, when its site color setting is an integer attribute, and a
<I>crange</I> setting from <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I> has been specified to set the color
associated with each integer value.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>I</I> value should be an integer from <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I>
inclusive.  A wildcard asterisk can be used in place of or in
conjunction with the <I>type</I> argument to specify a range of values.
This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  An asterisk with no
numeric values means all values from <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I>.  A leading asterisk
means all values from <I>lo</I> to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk
means all values from n to <I>hi</I> (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means
all values from m to n (inclusive).
</P>
<P>The specified <I>color</I> can be a single color which is any of the 140
pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the
dump_modify color option.  Or it can be two or more colors separated
by a "/" character, e.g. red/green/blue.  In the former case, that
color is assigned to all the specified integer values.  In the latter
case, the list of colors are assigned in a round-robin fashion to each
of the specified integer values.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>color</I> can also be the word <I>random</I>.  In this case,
random red/blue/green color values, each from 0.0 to 1.0, are
generated for each <I>I</I> value.  This is a convenient way to assign a
large number of random colors, without having to list them explicitly
by name.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>sdiam</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A>
command, when its site diameter setting is an integer attribute, and a
<I>drange</I> setting from <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I> has been specified to set the
diameter associated with each integer value.  The specified <I>I</I> value
should be an integer from <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I>.  As with the <I>scolor</I> keyword,
a wildcard asterisk can be used as part of the <I>I</I> argument to specify
a range of values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>smap</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A>
command, when its site color setting is a floating point attribute, to
setup a color map.  The color map is used to assign a specific RGB
(red/green/blue) color value to an individual site when it is drawn,
based on the atom's attribute, which is a numeric value, e.g. its x
coordinate, if the attribute "x" was specified.
</P>
<P>The basic idea of a color map is that the site-attribute will be
within a range of values, and that range is associated with a series
of colors (e.g. red, blue, green).  An sites's specific value (x =
-3.2) can then mapped to the series of colors (e.g. halfway between
red and blue), and a specific color is determined via an interpolation
procedure.
</P>
<P>There are many possible options for the color map, enabled by the
<I>smap</I> keyword.  Here are the details.
</P>
<P>The <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> settings determine the range of values allowed for
the site attribute.  If numeric values are used for <I>lo</I> and/or <I>hi</I>,
then values that are lower/higher than lo/hi are set to either <I>lo</I> or
<I>hi</I>.  I.e. the range is static.  If <I>lo</I> is specified as <I>min</I> or
<I>hi</I> as <I>max</I> then the range is dynamic, and the lower and/or upper
bound will be calculated each time an image is drawn, based on the set
of sites being visualized.
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> setting is two letters, such as "ca".  The first letter is
either "c" for continuous, "d" for discrete, or "s" for sequential.
The second letter is either "a" for absolute, or "f" for fractional.
</P>
<P>A continuous color map is one in which the color changes continuously
from value to value within the range.  A discrete color map is one in
which discrete colors are assigned to sub-ranges of values within the
range.  A sequential color map is one in which discrete colors are
assigned to a sequence of sub-ranges of values covering the entire
range.
</P>
<P>An absolute color map is one in which the values to which colors are
assigned are specified explicitly as values within the range.  A
fractional color map is one in which the values to which colors are
assigned are specified as a fractional portion of the range.  For
example if the range is from -10.0 to 10.0, and the color red is to be
assigned to atoms with a value of 5.0, then for an absolute color map
the number 5.0 would be used.  But for a fractional map, the number
0.75 would be used since 5.0 is 3/4 of the way from -10.0 to 10.0.
</P>
<P>The <I>delta</I> setting is only specified if the style is sequential.  It
specifies the bin size to use within the range for assigning
consecutive colors to.  For example, if the range is from -10.0 to
10.0 and a <I>delta</I> of 1.0 is used, then 20 colors will be assigned to
the range.  The first will be from -10.0 <= color1 < -9.0, then 2nd
from -9.0 <= color2 < -8.0, etc.
</P>
<P>The <I>N</I> setting is how many entries follow.  The format of the entries
depends on whether the color map style is continuous, discrete or
sequential.  In all cases the <I>color</I> setting can be any of the 140
pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the
dump_modify color option.
</P>
<P>For continuous color maps, each entry has a <I>value</I> and a <I>color</I>.
The <I>value</I> is either a number within the range of values or <I>min</I> or
<I>max</I>.  The <I>value</I> of the first entry must be <I>min</I> and the <I>value</I>
of the last entry must be <I>max</I>.  Any entries in between must have
increasing values.  Note that numeric values can be specified either
as absolute numbers or as fractions (0.0 to 1.0) of the range,
depending on the "a" or "f" in the style setting for the color map.
</P>
<P>Here is how the entries are used to determine the color of an
individual site, given the value X of its site attribute.  X will fall
between 2 of the entry values.  The color of the site is linearly
interpolated (in each of the RGB values) between the 2 colors
associated with those entries.  For example, if X = -5.0 and the 2
surrounding entries are "red" at -10.0 and "blue" at 0.0, then the
site's color will be halfway between "red" and "blue", which happens
to be "purple".
</P>
<P>For discrete color maps, each entry has a <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> value and a
<I>color</I>.  The <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> settings are either numbers within the
range of values or <I>lo</I> can be <I>min</I> or <I>hi</I> can be <I>max</I>.  The <I>lo</I>
and <I>hi</I> settings of the last entry must be <I>min</I> and <I>max</I>.  Other
entries can have any <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> values and the sub-ranges of
different values can overlap.  Note that numeric <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> values
can be specified either as absolute numbers or as fractions (0.0 to
1.0) of the range, depending on the "a" or "f" in the style setting
for the color map.
</P>
<P>Here is how the entries are used to determine the color of an
individual site, given the value X of its site attribute.  The entries
are scanned from first to last.  The first time that <I>lo</I> <= X <=
<I>hi</I>, X is assigned the color associated with that entry.  You can
think of the last entry as assigning a default color (since it will
always be matched by X), and the earlier entries as colors that
override the default.  Also note that no interpolation of a color RGB
is done.  All sites will be drawn with one of the colors in the list
of entries.
</P>
<P>For sequential color maps, each entry has only a <I>color</I>.  Here is how
the entries are used to determine the color of an individual site,
given the value X of its site attribute.  The range is partitioned
into N bins of width <I>binsize</I>.  Thus X will fall in a specific bin
from 1 to N, say the Mth bin.  If it falls on a boundary between 2
bins, it is considered to be in the higher of the 2 bins.  Each bin is
assigned a color from the E entries.  If E < N, then the colors are
repeated.  For example if 2 entries with colors red and green are
specified, then the odd numbered bins will be red and the even bins
green.  The color of the site is the color of its bin.  Note that the
sequential color map is really a shorthand way of defining a discrete
color map without having to specify where all the bin boundaries are.

<P>These are the 140 colors that SPPARKS pre-defines for use with the
<A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> and dump_modify commands.  Additional
colors can be defined with the dump_modify color command.  The 3
numbers listed for each name are the RGB (red/green/blue) values.
Divide each value by 255 to get the equivalent 0.0 to 1.0 value.
