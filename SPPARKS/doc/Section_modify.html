<H3>8. Modifying & extending SPPARKS 
</H3>
<P>SPPARKS is designed in a modular fashion so as to be easy to modify and
extend with new functionality.
</P>
<P>In this section, changes and additions users can make are listed along
with minimal instructions.  If you add a new feature to SPPARKS and
think it will be of interest to general users, we encourage you to
submit it to the developers for inclusion in the released version of
SPPARKS.
</P>
<P>The best way to add a new feature is to find a similar feature in
SPPARKS and look at the corresponding source and header files to figure
out what it does.  You will need some knowledge of C++ to be able to
understand the hi-level structure of SPPARKS and its class
organization, but functions (class methods) that do actual
computations are written in vanilla C-style code and operate on simple
C-style data structures (vectors and arrays).
</P>
<P>Most of the new features described in this section require you to
write a new C++ derived class.  Creating a new class requires 2 files,
a source code file (*.cpp) and a header file (*.h).  The derived class
must provide certain methods to work as a new option.  Depending on
how different your new feature is compared to existing features, you
can either derive from the base class itself, or from a derived class
that already exists.  Enabling SPPARKS to invoke the new class is as
simple as adding two lines to the style_user.h file, in the same
syntax as other SPPARKS classes are specified in the style.h file.
</P>
<P>The advantage of C++ and its object-orientation is that all the code
and variables needed to define the new feature are in the 2 files you
write, and thus shouldn't make the rest of SPPARKS more complex or
cause side-effect bugs.
</P>
<P>Here is a concrete example.  Suppose you write 2 files app_foo.cpp and
app_foo.h that define a new class AppFoo that implements a Monte Carlo
model described in the classic 1997 <A HREF = "#Foo">paper</A> by Foo, et al.  If
you wish to invoke that application in a SPPARKS input script with a
command like
</P>
<PRE>app_style foo 0.1 3.5 
</PRE>
<P>you put your 2 files in the SPPARKS src directory and re-make the
code.  The app_foo.h file should have these lines at the top
</P>
<PRE>#ifdef APP_CLASS
AppStyle(foo,AppFoo)
#else 
</PRE>
<P>where "foo" is the style keyword to be used in the app_style command,
and AppFoo is the class name in your C++ files.
</P>
<P>When you re-make SPPARKS, your new application becomes part of the
executable and can be invoked with a app_style command like the
example above.  Arguments like 0.1 and 3.5 can be defined and
processed by your new class.
</P>
<P>Here is a list of the new features that can be added in this way.
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "#app">Application styles</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#diag">Diagnostic styles</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#command">Input script commands</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#solve">Solve styles</A> 
</UL>
<P>As illustrated by the application example, these options are referred
to in the SPPARKS documentation as the "style" of a particular
command.
</P>
<P>The instructions below give the header file for the base class that
these styles are derived from.  Public variables in that file are ones
used and set by the derived classes which are also used by the base
class.  Sometimes they are also used by the rest of SPPARKS.  Virtual
functions in the base class header file which are set = 0 are ones you
must define in your new derived class to give it the functionality
SPPARKS expects.  Virtual functions that are not set to 0 are functions
you can optionally define.

<A NAME = "app"></A><H4>Application styles 
</H4>
<P>In SPPARKS, applications are what define the simulation model that is
evolved via Monte Carlo algorithms.  A new model typically requires
adding a new application to the code.  Read the doc page for the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command to understand the distinction
between on-lattice and off-lattice applications.  A new off-lattice
application can be anything you wish.  On-lattice applications are
derive from the AppLattice class.
</P>
<P>For on-lattice and off-lattice applications, here is a brief
description of methods you define in your new derived class.  Some of
them are required; some are optional.  See app.h for details.
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >input_app</TD><TD > additional commands the application defines</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >grow_app</TD><TD > set pointers to per-site arrays used by the application</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >init_app</TD><TD > initialize the application before a run</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >site_energy</TD><TD > compute energy of a site</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >site_event_rejection</TD><TD > peform an event with null-bin rejection (for rKMC)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD >site_event</TD><TD > perform an event (for KMC) 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Note that two of the methods are required if you want your application
to perform kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) with a <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solver</A>.
One of the methods is required if you want your application to perform
rejection KMC (rKMC) with a <A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep method</A>.
</P>
<P>The constructor for your application class also needs to define, to
insure proper operation with the "KMC solvers'_solve.html and
rejection KMC <A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep methods</A>.  These are the flags, all of
which have default values set in app_lattice.cpp:
</P>

<A NAME = "diag"></A><H4>Diagnostic styles 
</H4>
<P>Diagnostic classes compute some form of analysis periodically during a
simulation.  See the <A HREF = "diag_style.html">diag_style</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>To add a new diagnostic, here is a brief description of methods you
define in your new derived class.  Some of them are required; some are
optional.  See diag.h for details.
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >

<TR><TD >stats</TD><TD > fields added to statistics by this diagnostic 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<HR>

<A NAME = "command"></A><H4>Input script commands 
</H4>
<P>New commands can be added to SPPARKS input scripts by adding new
classes that have a "command" method and are listed in the Command
sections of style_user.h (or style.h).  For example, the shell
commands (cd, mkdir, rm, etc) are implemented in this fashion.  When
such a command is encountered in the SPPARKS input script, SPPARKS
simply creates a class with the corresponding name, invokes the
"command" method of the class, and passes it the arguments from the
input script.  The command method can perform whatever operations it
wishes on SPPARKS data structures.
</P>
<P>The single method your new class must define is as follows:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >command</TD><TD > operations performed by the new command 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Of course, the new class can define other methods and variables as
needed.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "solve"></A><H4>Solve styles 
</H4>
<P>In SPPARKS, a solver performs the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) operation
of selecting an event from a list of events and associated
probabilities.  See the <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> command for
details.
</P>
<P>To add a new KMC solver, here is a brief description of methods you
define in your new derived class.  Some of them are required; some are
optional.  See diag.h for details.
</P>
<P>Here is a brief description of methods you define in your new derived
class.  All of them are required.  See solve.h for details.
