dump_one command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump_one dump-ID :pre

dump-ID = ID of previously defined dump :ul

[Examples:]

dump_one mine
dump_one 2 :pre

[Description:]

Dump the current state of the lattice to the dump file defined by the
"dump"_dump.html command with this {dump-ID}.  This can be useful
before or after a run, if the "dump"_dump.html command itself did not
produce a snapshot at the desired time or state.

The information dumped is determined by the "dump"_dump.html command
which must have been previously specified to use the dump_one command.

[Restrictions:]

This command cannot be used to trigger the very first snapshot written
to the file specified with the "dump"_dump.html command.

[Related commands:]

"dump"_dump.html

[Default:] none
