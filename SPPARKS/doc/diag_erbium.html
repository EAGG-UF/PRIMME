<H3>diag_style erbium command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>diag_style erbium keyword value keyword value ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>erbium = style name of this diagnostic 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>see the <A HREF = "diag_style.html">diag_style</A> command for additional keyword/value pairs that can be appended to a diagnostic command and which must appear before these keywords 

<LI>keyword = <I>list</I> 

<PRE>  <I>list</I> values = <I>er</I> or <I>h</I> or <I>he</I> or <I>vac</I> or <I>events</I> or <I>sN</I> or <I>dN</I> or <I>tN</I>
    <I>er</I>,<I>h</I>,<I>he</I>,<I>vac</I> = counts of how many lattice sites of this type exist
    <I>events</I> = total # of events for all sites
    <I>sN</I>,<I>dN</I>,<I>tN</I> = cummulative # of events for this reaction that have occurred

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The erbium diagnostic prints out statistics about the system being
modeled by <A HREF = "app_erbium.html">app_style erbium</A>.  The values will be
printed as part of <A HREF = "stats.html">stats</A> output.
</P>
<P>Following the <I>list</I> keyword you can list one or more of the listed
values, in any order.
</P>
<P>The <I>er</I>, <I>h</I>, <I>he</I>, and <I>vac</I> values will print counts of the number
of current sites of each type.  The <I>events</I> value will print the
total # of possible events that can occur as defined by the
<A HREF = "event.html">event</A> command, given the current state of the lattice,
summed over all sites.
</P>
<P>The <I>sN</I>, <I>dN</I>, and <I>tN</I> values refer to a tally of events that have
actually occurred, as defined by the <A HREF = "event.html">event</A> command.  The
letter "s" means reactions involving a single site, "d" means double
reactions involving 2 sites, and "t" means triple reactions involving
3 sites.  The N refers to which reaction (from 1 to the number of that
type of reaction).  I.e. "t2" means the 2nd 3-site reaction defined in
your input script.  Note that the values printed for <I>sN</I>, <I>dN</I>, and
<I>tN</I> are cummulative counts of events from the beginning of the
simulation run.

erbium</A> application.
