am_transverse_pass command :h3

[Syntax:]

am_transverse_pass id distance D increment I :pre

id = integer identification number for this transverse pass
distance = required keyword
D = total transverse_pass distance
increment = required keyword
I = transverse distance between each pass :ul

[Examples:]

am_pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0
am_transverse_pass 1 distance 65.0 increment 10 :pre

[Description:]

This command is used in the "potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html
application to specify the parameters of the transverse_pass
subcomponent of a raster pattern. Multiple transverse passes can be
defined in a single input file, using unique id values.

The {distance} value {D} key/value should typically be the box size
transverse to the current pass direction.

The {increment} value {I} defines the transverse distance between
passes defined in the "pass"_am_pass.html command.  It should
typically be smaller than the molten zone width to achieve full
coverage.

Note that the {distance} and {increment} values together implicitly
define the number of passes when used to define a "rectangular_layer"
via the "am_cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html command.

In the above example, a pass along the {X} axis is defined.  The
transverse_pass command defines the distance {increment 10} between
each pass as well as implicitly defining the number of passes based
upon the keyword/value pair {distance 10.0}.  The schematic below
illustrates this geometry.
