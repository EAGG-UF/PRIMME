app_style potts/strain/pin command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style potts/strain/pin Q :pre

potts/strain/pin = application style name
Q = number of spin states :ul

[Examples:]

app_style potts/strain/pin 100 :pre

[Description:]

This is an on-lattice application which evolves a Q-state Potts model
with a per-site strain, where each lattice site has a spin value from
1 to Q.  The application also allows for pinning of sites using a
special spin value of Q+1.  Sites flip their spin as the model evolves
but sites are not allowed to flip to a pinned value; sites with pinned
values also do not flip.  Strain energy can influence grain growth.

See the "app_style potts_strain"_app_potts_strain.html and
"pin"_pin.html commands for details on how strain and pinned sites are
incorporated into this application.
