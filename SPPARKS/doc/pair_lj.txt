pair_style lj command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style lj Ntypes cutoff :pre

lj = style name of this pair style
Ntypes = # of particle types
cutoff = global cutoff for pairwise interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style lj 1 2.5
pair_style lj 3 3.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {lj/cut} style computes the standard 12/6 Lennard-Jones potential,
given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_lj.jpg)

Rc is the cutoff.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of particle
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command, or by mixing as
described below:

epsilon (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

Note that sigma is defined in the LJ formula as the zero-crossing
distance for the potential, not as the energy minimum at 2^(1/6)
sigma.

The last coefficients is optional.  If not specified, the global LJ
cutoff specified in the pair_style command is used.

[Mixing info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon and sigma coefficients
and cutoff distance for all of the lj/cut pair styles can be mixed.
The style of mixing is {geometric}, which means that

epsilon_ij = sqrt(epsilon_i * epsilon_j)
sigma_ij = sqrt(sigma_i * sigma_j) :pre
