<H3>stats command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>stats delta keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>delta = time increment between statistical output (seconds) 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>delay</I> or <I>logfreq</I> or <I>loglinfreq</I> 

<PRE>  <I>delay</I> value = tdelay
    tdelay = delay stats until at least this time (seconds)
  <I>logfreq</I> or <I>loglinfreq</I> values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between intervals 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.1
stats 0.1 delta 0.5
stats 1.0 loglinfreq 7 10.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Print statistics to the screen and log file every so many seconds
during a simulation.  A value of 0.0 for delta means only print stats
at the beginning and end of the run, in which case no optional
keywords can be used.
</P>
<P>The quantities printed are elapsed CPU time followed by those provided
by the <A HREF = "app_style.html">application</A>, followed by those provided by any
<A HREF = "diag_style.html">diagnostics</A> you have defined.
</P>
<P>Typically the application reports only the number of events or sweeps
executed, followed by the simulation time, but other
application-specific quantities may also be reported.  Quantities such
as the total energy of the system can be included in the output by
creating diagnostics via the <A HREF = "diag_style.html">diag_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>delay</I> keyword will suppress output until <I>tdelay</I> time has
elapsed.
</P>
<P>Using the <I>logfreq</I> or <I>loglinfreq</I> keyword will produce statistical 
output at progressively larger intervals during the course of a simulation.  
There will be <I>N</I> outputs per interval where the size of the interval is 
initially <I>delta</I> and then scales up by <I>factor</I> each time. With <I>loglinfreq</I>,
output times increase arithmetically within an interval; with <I>logfreq</I> the 
output times increase geometrically.
</P>
<P>For example, this command
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.1 loglinfreq 7 10.0 
</PRE>
<P>will produce output at times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.7, 1, 2, ...., 7, 10, 20, .... 
</PRE>
<P>This command
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.1 logfreq 1 2.0 
</PRE>
<P>will produce output at times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, ... 
</PRE>
<P>This command
</P>
<PRE>stats 1.0 logfreq 10 10.0 
</PRE>
<P>will produce output at times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 1.0, 1.26, 1.58, 2.00, 2.51, 3.16, 3.98, 5.01, 6.31, 7.94, 10.0, ... 
</PRE>
<P>Note that in the above examples the times are the earliest times that output will
be produced. In practice, because time is incremented in discrete jumps, output
 will be produced at times somewhat later than these times.
</P>
<P>If <I>N</I> is specified as 0, then this will turn off logarithmic output,
and revert to regular output every <I>delta</I> seconds.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>See the doc pages for quantities provided by particular
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> and <A HREF = "diag_style.html">diag_style</A> commands
for further details.

</P>
<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>The default stats delta is 0.0.  The keyword defaults are delay = 0.0
and no logarithmic output.
