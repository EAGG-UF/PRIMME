<H3>app_style potts/weld command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<P>app_style style nspins yp alpha beta velocity haz
</P>
<LI>style = potts/weld 

<LI>nspins = number of possible Potts model spins 

<LI>yp = initial melt pool position along y-axis 

<LI>alpha = controls relative size of melt pool shape at bottom compared to top 

<LI>beta = Bezier control point parameter that defines curvature of melt pool shape through thickness  

<LI>velocity = velocity of melt pool motion (lattice sites per Monte Carlo step) 

<LI>haz = width of the heat affected zone (haz) surrounding the melt pool

<PRE>app_style potts/weld 10000 0 0.5 0.75 7.0 50.0
weld_shape_ellipse 100.0 150.0 
</PRE>
<P>This defines a potts/weld model with 10000 spins. An elliptical pool
shape is specified with width and length of 100 and 150 sites
respectively; note these are pool dimensions at the top surface of the
weld.  The value <I>alpha=0.5</I> scales the elliptical pool width and
length at the top surface to 50 and 75 sites respectively at the
bottom (root) surface of the weld.  The Bezier control point parameter
specifies an outwardly curved pool; the weld speed is 7 MCS and the
heat effect zone is 50 sites wide.
</P>
<P>This application also requires one of the following commands to
specify pool geometry:

<P>This is an on-lattice application derived from the <A HREF = "app_potts.html">app_style
potts/neighonly</A> command.  It simulates grain growth
associated with a butt-weld process.  Two sheets of material of equal
thickness are assumed to be just touching; this defines a joint to be
welded.
</P>
<P>Grain growth associated with joining the plates in a weld process is
simulated by translating a weld pool (simulates melt) along the joint
(aligned with the y-coordinate axis).  The weld pool is translated
with a speed defined by <I>velocity</I>.  The weld pool geometry is defined
using an elliptical pool <A HREF = "weld_shape_ellipse.html">(weld_shape_ellipse)</A> 
or a teardrop shaped pool <A HREF = "weld_shape_teardrop.html">(weld_shape_teardrop)</A>;
these commands define the pool size and shape at the top surface
of the plates joined. It is assumed that the weld fully penetrates the
thickess of the plates; the parameter 1 >= <I>alpha</I> > 0 defines the
the pool size at the bottom (root) of the plates relative to the
top.  The thickness of the plates joined is assumed to be the number
of lattice sites along the z-axis defined in <A HREF = "region.html">region</A>
command.  Curvature of the pool in the plate thickness direction is
controlled by the parameter 1 >= <I>beta</I> >= 0.  When <I>beta</I> is less
than 0.5, the slope of the pool surface is increasing from top to
bottom; when <I>beta</I> is greater than 0.5, the slope of the pool surface
is decreasing from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>The model simulates melting and re-solidification by randomizing the
spin at a lattice site when it falls within the melt pool's
volume. Upon exiting the melt pool, a rejection kinetic Monte Carlo
event is performed at the site, and the spin is flipped to the value
of one of its neighbors (in the style of the
<A HREF = "app_potts.html">potts/neighonly</A> application).
</P>
<P>The mobility of each site within the <I>haz</I> region decreases linearly
with increasing distance from the melt pool surface. The maximum
mobility is 1 at the melt pool boundary and the minimum mobility is 0
at the outer boundary of the heat affected zone as defined by
<I>haz</I>. The mobility gradient is similar to that in
<A HREF = "app_potts_grad.html">potts/grad</A>, but is restricted to a smaller
portion of the simulation domain as defined by the heat affected zone
parameter <I>haz</I>.
</P>
<P>Outside of the melt pool and heat affected zone, grain boundary
mobility is set to 0, and grain evolution does not occur.
</P>
<P>Use the <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A> command to initialize the
microstructure of plates welded; alternatively the <A HREF = "set.html">set</A>
command can be used to initialize the base metal microstructure.
