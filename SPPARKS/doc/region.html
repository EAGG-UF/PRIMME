</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command defines a geometric region of space.  Various other
commands use regions.  For example, the region can be filled with
sites via the <A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command.
</P>
<P>The distance units used to define the region are setup by the
<A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command which must be used before any regions
are defined.  The lattice command defines a lattice spacing and
regions are defined in terms of this length scale.  For example, if
the lattice spacing is 3.0 and the region sphere radius is 2.5, then
the size of the sphere is 2.5*3.0 = 7.5.
</P>
<P>Commands which use regions typically test whether a lattice site is
contained in the region or not.  For this purpose, coordinates exactly
on the region boundary are considered to be interior to the region.
This means, for example, for a spherical region, a lattice site on the
sphere surface would be part of the region if the sphere were defined
with the <I>side in</I> keyword, but would not be part of the region if it
were defined using the <I>side out</I> keyword.  See more details on the
<I>side</I> keyword below.
</P>
<P>The lo/hi values for the <I>block</I> or <I>cylinder</I> styles can be specified
as EDGE or INF.  EDGE means they extend all the way to the global
simulation box boundary.  Note that this is the current box boundary;
if the box changes size during a simulation, the region does not.  INF
means a large negative or positive number (1.0e20), so it should
encompass the simulation box even if it changes size.  If a region is
defined before the simulation box has been created (via
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> or <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A>
commands), then an EDGE or INF parameter cannot be used.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Regions in SPPARKS are always 3d geometric objects,
regardless of whether the <A HREF = "dimension.html">dimension</A> of the lattice is
1d or 2d or 3d.  Thus when using regions in a 2d simulation, for
exapmle, you should be careful to define the region so that its
intersection with the 2d x-y plane of the simulation has the 2d
geometric extent you want.  Also note that for 2d simulations, SPPARKS
expects lattice sites to lie in the z=0 plane, and similarly for 1d (y
= z = 0), so the regions you define as input to the
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command should reflect that.
</P>
<P>For style <I>cylinder</I>, the c1,c2 params are coordinates in the 2 other
dimensions besides the cylinder axis dimension.  For dim = x, c1/c2 =
y/z; for dim = y, c1/c2 = x/z; for dim = z, c1/c2 = x/y.  Thus the
third example above specifies a cylinder with its axis in the
y-direction located at x = 2.0 and z = 3.0, with a radius of 5.0, and
extending in the y-direction from -5.0 to the upper box boundary.
</P>
<P>The <I>union</I> style creates a region consisting of the volume of all the
listed regions combined.  The <I>intersect</I> style creates a region
consisting of the volume that is common to all the listed regions.
</P>
<P>The <I>side</I> keyword determines whether the region is considered to be
inside or outside of the specified geometry.  Using this keyword in
conjunction with <I>union</I> and <I>intersect</I> regions, complex geometries
can be built up.  For example, if the interior of two spheres were
each defined as regions, and a <I>union</I> style with <I>side</I> = out was
constructed listing the region-IDs of the 2 spheres, the resulting
region would be all the volume in the simulation box that was outside
both of the spheres.
