<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are on-lattice applications which evolve a 2-state Ising model,
where each lattice site has a spin of 1 or 2.  Sites flip their spin
as the model evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>Hi = Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and
delta_ij is 0 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 1 if they
are different.  The energy of the entire system is the sum of Hi over
all sites.
</P>
<P>This application performs Glauber dynamics, meaning the spin is
flipped on a single site.  See <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> for an Ising model which performs
Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two neighboring sites are
swapped.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, this application can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver or sweeping method to be
used with the application via the <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> or
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip and its
probability is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
using the Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T
is the temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>For solution by a rKMC algorithm, the <I>ising</I> and <I>ising/single</I>
styles use a different rejection-based algorithm.  For the <I>ising</I>
style, the spin is set randomly to 1 or 2.  For the <I>ising/single</I>
style, the spin is flipped to its opposite value.  In either case, dE
= Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform random number R
between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)].
