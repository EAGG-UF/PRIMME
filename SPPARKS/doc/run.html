<H3>run command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>run delta keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>delta = run simulation for this amount of time (seconds) 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>upto</I> or <I>pre</I> or <I>post</I> 

<PRE>  <I>upto</I> value = none
  <I>pre</I> value = <I>no</I> or <I>yes</I>
  <I>post</I> value = <I>no</I> or <I>yes</I> 
</PRE>

<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>run 100.0
run 10000.0 upto
run 1000 pre no post yes 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command runs a Monte Carlo application for the specified number
of seconds of simulation time.  If multiple run commands are used,
the simulation is continued, possibly with new settings which were
specified between the successive run commands.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "app_style.html">application</A> defines Monte Carlo events and
probabilities which determine the amount of physical time associated
with each event.
</P>
<P>A value of delta = 0.0 is acceptable; only the status of the system is
computed and printed without making any Monte Carlo moves.
</P>
<P>The <I>upto</I> keyword means to perform a run starting at the current time
up to the specified time.  E.g. if the current time is 10.0 and "run
100.0 upto" is used, then an additional 90.0 seconds will be run.
This can be useful for very long runs on a machine that allocates
chunks of time and terminate your job when time is exceeded.  If you
need to restart your script multiple times (after reading in the last
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump sites</A> snapshot via the <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A>
command), you can keep restarting your script with the same run
command until the simulation finally completes.
</P>
<P>The <I>pre</I> and <I>post</I> keywords can be used to streamline the setup,
clean-up, and associated output to the screen that happens before and
after a run.  This can be useful if you wish to do many short runs in
succession (e.g. SPPARKS is being called as a library which is doing
other computations between successive short SPPARKS runs).
</P>
<P>By default (pre and post = <I>yes</I>), SPPARKS initializes data structures
and computes propensities before every run.  After every run it
gathers and prints timings statistics.  If a run is just a
continuation of a previous run, the data structure initialization is
not necessary.  So if <I>pre</I> is specified as <I>no</I> then the
initialization is skipped.  Propensities are still re-computed since
commands between runs or a driver program may have changed the system,
e.g. by altering lattice values.  Note that if <I>pre</I> is set to <I>no</I>
for the very 1st run SPPAKRS performs, then it is overridden, since
the initialization must be done.
</P>
<P>If <I>post</I> is specified as <I>no</I>, the full timing summary is skipped;
only a one-line summary timing is printed.
