app_style test/group command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style test/group N Nmax pmax pmin delta keyword value :pre

test/group = application style name :ulb,l
N = # of events to choose from :l
Mmax = max number of dependencies for each event :l
pmax = max probability :l
pmin = min probability :l
delta = percentage adjustment factor for dependent probabilities :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {lomem} :l
  {lomem} value = {yes} or {no} :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

app_style test/group 10000 30 1.0 1.0e-6 5
app_style test/group 10000 30 1.0 1.0e-9 10 lomem yes :pre

[Description:]

This is a general application which creates and evolves an artificial
network of coupled events to test the performance and scalability of
various kinetic Monte Carlo "solvers"_solve_style.html.  See the paper
by "(Slepoy)"_#Slepoy for additional details on how it has been used.

The set of coupled events can be thought of as a reaction network with
N different chemical rate equations or events to choose from.  Each
equation is coupled to M randomly chosen other equations, where M is a
uniform random number from 1 to Mmax.  In a chemical reaction sense it
is as if an executed reaction creates M product molecules, each of
which is a reactant in another reaction, affecting its probability of
occurrence.

Initially, the maximum and minimum probability for each event is an
exponentially distributed random value between {pmax} and {pmin}.  If
"solve_style group"_solve_style.html is used, these values should be
the same as the {pmax} and {pmin} used as parameters in that command.
Pmin must be greater than 0.0.

As events are executed, the artificial network updates the
probabilities of dependent reactions directly by adjusting their
probability by a uniform random number betwee -delta and +delta.
Since delta is specified as a percentatge, this means pold * (1 -
delta/100) <= pnew <= pold * (1 + delta/100).  Delta must be less than
100.

If the {lomem} keyword is set to {no}, then the random connectivity of
the network is generated beforehand and stored.  This is faster when
events are executed but limits the size of problem that will fit in
memory.  If {lomem} is set to {yes}, then the connectivity is
generated on the fly, as each event is executed.

This application can only be evolved using a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver to be used with the
application via the "solve_style"_solve_style.html command

When the "run"_run.html command is used with this application it sets
the number of events to perform, not the time for the run.  E.g.

run 10000 :pre

means to perform 10000 events, not to run for 10000 seconds.
